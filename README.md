# Weather-Prediction-using-Computer-Vision

## Objective

In this project, I will try to estimate the atmospheric temperature at Rainbow Bridge, Tokyo by looking at the images of this location.

## Method

I will be using a convolutional neural network to train a model that predicts the temperature at the moment the image was taken. 
Our task will be a regression task as our target variable (temperature) is a continuous variable.While image convolution is mostly used for classification problems such as object detection or face recognition, it is not common to use it for a regression task, hence there are not a lot of materials about this online.
